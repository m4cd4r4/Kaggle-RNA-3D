# Stanford RNA 3D Folding Part 2

**Kaggle Competition**: [stanford-rna-3d-folding-2](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/stanford-rna-3d-folding-2)

## Competition Overview

- **Goal**: Predict the 3D structure of RNA molecules from their sequences
- **Prize Pool**: $75,000
- **Dataset Size**: 23.4 GB (competition data)
- **Entry Deadline**: March 18, 2026
- **Hosts**: Stanford Medicine + HHMI Janelia
- **Challenge**: "Solve RNA structure prediction - one of biology's remaining grand challenges"

## Background & Motivation

Understanding RNA three-dimensional structure is essential for advancing research in:
- Medicine and drug discovery
- Molecular biology
- Synthetic biology design
- RNA-targeting therapeutics

The structural flexibility of RNA leads to scarcity of experimentally determined data, making computational prediction critical but challenging.

## Part 1 Competition Insights (Key Learnings)

### Competition Results
- **1,700+ teams** participated
- **43 previously unreleased structures** as test set
- **Top 3 winners**: "john", "odat", and team "Eigen"
- **Performance**: Mean TM-align scores of **0.671**, **0.653**, and **0.615** on Public leaderboard

### Winning Approaches

#### 🏆 Template-Based Modeling (Surprise Winner!)
The most unexpected finding: **the top strategy used template-based modeling WITHOUT deep learning**.

Key insights:
- Template discovery pipeline outperformed deep learning approaches
- Winners achieved scores within statistical error of CASP16 competition winners
- **All three top teams significantly outperformed AlphaFold 3**
- Post-competition, the organizers developed **RNAPro** by integrating Kaggle strategies

#### Deep Learning Approaches (Also Competitive)
Teams used diverse strategies including:
- **RNA foundation models**: Aido.RNA, RNet
- **Language model-based methods**: RhoFold+
- **Multi-modal approaches**: Combining sequence, structure, and MSA features

### Key Takeaway
> "Template-based modeling shows growing importance in RNA structure prediction"

## State-of-the-Art Methods (2024)

### 1. RhoFold+ (Leading Deep Learning Method)
- **Type**: RNA language model-based deep learning
- **Training**: Pretrained on ~23.7 million RNA sequences
- **Performance**: Superior on RNA-Puzzles and CASP15
- **Advantage**: Fully automated end-to-end pipeline

### 2. AlphaFold 3
- **Publisher**: DeepMind (Nature, 2024)
- **Capability**: Biomolecular interactions including RNA
- **Limitation**: Comparable to ML methods, challenges with ligand binding

### 3. RoseTTAFoldNA
- **Extension of**: RoseTTAFold (protein structure prediction)
- **Specialty**: Protein-DNA and protein-RNA complexes
- **Output**: 3D structures with confidence estimates

### 4. Other Notable Methods
- DRfold, DeepFoldRNA, trRosettaRNA
- Template-based methods (validated by Part 1 winners)

## Evaluation Metrics

### TM-score (Template Modeling score)
- Range: [0, 1] (1 = identical structures)
- Scale-independent structural similarity measure
- **Primary metric** for Part 1 competition

### Other Important Metrics
- **RMSD**: Root Mean Square Deviation
- **GDT-TS**: Global Distance Test - Total Score
- **lDDT**: Local Distance Difference Test
- **Pairwise Distance Accuracy**: Correctly predicted distances
